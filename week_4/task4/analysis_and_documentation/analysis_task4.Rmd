```{r}

data_candy %>%
    select(candy, rating) %>% 
  group_by(candy) %>% 
  summarise(candy_total = n()) %>% 
  nrow()
```

*There is a total of 108 candy*

#### What was the average age of people who are going out trick or treating and the average age of people 3. not going trick or treating?

```{r}

options(scipen=999)

data_candy %>% 
  select(trick_or_treat, age) %>% 
  group_by(trick_or_treat) %>% 
  summarise(avg_age = mean(age, na.rm=TRUE))

data_candy %>% 
  select(trick_or_treat, age) %>% 
  filter(trick_or_treat == "Yes") %>% 
  arrange(desc(age))
```


#### For each of joy, despair and meh, which candy bar revived the most of these ratings?

```{r}

#JOY candy rating
data_candy %>% 
  select(candy, rating) %>%

  arrange(desc(rating_total))

#DESPAIR candy rating

data_candy %>% 
  select(candy, rating) %>%

#MEH candy rating

data_candy %>% 
  select(candy, rating) %>% 
  filter(rating == "MEH") %>% 
  group_by(candy) %>% 
  summarise(rating_total = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(rating_total))
  
  
  # group_by(rating) %>%
