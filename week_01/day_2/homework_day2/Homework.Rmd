Create vectors

```{r}
stock_prices <- c(23, 27, 23, 21, 34, 24, 25, 30, 37, 30)
day_of_week <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
day_of_week_factor <- as.factor(day_of_week)
names(stock_prices) <- day_of_week
named_stock_prices <- stock_prices
```

```{r}
stock_data <- data.frame(stock_prices, day_of_week)
View(stock_data)
```

```{r}
stock_list <- list(
  "Prices" = list(stock_prices),
  "Days" = list(day_of_week), 
  "Stock" = list(stock_data)
)
stock_list
```

Part 2

```{r}
stock_prices[4:6]
stock_prices[stock_prices>30]
stock_data$stock_prices
stock_data[stock_data$stock_prices<25,]
stock_data[,1]
stock_data[3,]
stock_data[3,1]
stock_list$Stock
```
